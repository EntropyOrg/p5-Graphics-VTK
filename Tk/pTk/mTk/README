As of release based on vtk31 this 'mTk' directory 
contains _complete_ sources of the relavent vtk TCL source files 
in their minimally modified
forms.

This is because 'munging' to pTk directory from either modified form
or original Tk becomes very complex now Tk is split unix/generic.

It should also makes merging changes less error prone.
