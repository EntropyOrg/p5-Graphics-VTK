// .NAME vtkXRenderWindowTclInteractor - a TCL event driven interface for a RenderWindow
// .SECTION Description
// vtkXRenderWindowTclInteractor is a convenience object that provides event
// bindings to common graphics functions. For example, camera and actor
// functions such as zoom-in/zoom-out, azimuth, roll, and pan. IT is one of
// the window system specific subclasses of vtkRenderWindowInteractor. Please
// see vtkRenderWindowInteractor documentation for event bindings.
//
// .SECTION see also
// vtkRenderWindowInteractor vtkXRenderWindow

{
public:
  static vtkXRenderWindowTclInteractor *New();
  vtkTypeMacro(vtkXRenderWindowTclInteractor,vtkRenderWindowInteractor);
  void PrintSelf(ostream& os, vtkIndent indent);

  // Description:
  // Initializes the event handlers without an XtAppContext.  This is
  // good for when you don't have a user interface, but you still
  // want to have mouse interaction.
  virtual void Initialize();

  // Description: 
  // Initializes the event handlers using an XtAppContext that you have
  // provided.  This assumes that you want to own the event loop.
  virtual void Initialize(XtAppContext app);
  vtkGetMacro( App, XtAppContext );
  
  // Description:
  // Enable/Disable interactions.  By default interactors are enabled when
  // initialized.  Initialize() must be called prior to enabling/disabling
  // interaction. These methods are used when a window/widget is being
  // shared by multiple renderers and interactors.  This allows a "modal"
  // display where one interactor is active when its data is to be displayed
  // and all other interactors associated with the widget are disabled
  // when their data is not displayed.
  virtual void Enable();
  virtual void Disable();

  // Description:
  // This will start up the X event loop and never return. If you
  // call this method it will loop processing X events until the
  // application is exited.
  virtual void Start();
  virtual void UpdateSize(int,int);

  // Description:
  // Specify the Xt widget to use for interaction. This method is
  // one of a couple steps that are required for setting up a
  // vtkRenderWindowInteractor as a widget inside of another user 
  // interface. You do not need to use this method if the render window
  // will be a stand-alone window. This is only used when you want the
  // render window to be a subwindow within a larger user interface.
  // In that case, you must tell the render window what X display id
  // to use, and then ask the render window what depth, visual and 
  // colormap it wants. Then, you must create an Xt TopLevelShell with
  // those settings. Then you can create the rest of your user interface
  // as a child of the TopLevelShell you created. Eventually, you will 
  // create a drawing area or some other widget to serve as the rendering
  // window. You must use the SetWidget method to tell this Interactor
  // about that widget. It's X and it's not terribly easy, but it looks cool.
  virtual void SetWidget(Widget);
  Widget GetWidget() {return this->top;};
  

  // Description
  // This method will store the top level shell widget for the interactor.
  // This method and the method invocation sequence applies for:
  //     1 vtkRenderWindow-Interactor pair in a nested widget heirarchy
  //     multiple vtkRenderWindow-Interactor pairs in the same top level shell
  // It is not needed for
  //     1 vtkRenderWindow-Interactor pair as the direct child of a top level shell
  //     multiple vtkRenderWindow-Interactor pairs, each in its own top level shell
  //
  // The method, along with EnterNotify event, changes the keyboard focus among
  // the widgets/vtkRenderWindow(s) so the Interactor(s) can receive the proper
  // keyboard events. The following calls need to be made:
  //     vtkRenderWindow's display ID need to be set to the top level shell's
  //           display ID.
  //     vtkXRenderWindowInteractor's Widget has to be set to the vtkRenderWindow's
  //           container widget
  //     vtkXRenderWindowInteractor's TopLevel has to be set to the top level
  //           shell widget
  // note that the procedure for setting up render window in a widget needs to
  // be followed.  See vtkRenderWindowInteractor's SetWidget method.
  //
  // If multiple vtkRenderWindow-Interactor pairs in SEPARATE windows are desired,
  // do not set the display ID (Interactor will create them as needed.  Alternatively,
  // create and set distinct DisplayID for each vtkRenderWindow. Using the same
  // display ID without setting the parent widgets will cause the display to be
  // reinitialized every time an interactor is initialized), do not set the
  // widgets (so the render windows would be in their own windows), and do
  // not set TopLevelShell (each has its own top level shell already)
  virtual void SetTopLevelShell(Widget);
  Widget GetTopLevelShell() {return this->TopLevelShell;};
