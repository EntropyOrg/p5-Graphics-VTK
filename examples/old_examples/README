The scripts in the graphics, imaging, contrib, and patented subdirectores
are converted from the tcl examples that came with the old VTK 3.2 package.

There were auto-converted (for the most part) using a tcl2perl script
in this directory. Not all of the converted scripts have been tested.

Additionally, there is some examples in the Pipeline directory which
contain sample scripts using the Pipeline widget.
